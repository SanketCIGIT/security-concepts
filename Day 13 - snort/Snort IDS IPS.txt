IDS/IPS (SPI/DPI)
```````````````````

What is a Intrusion Detection System?
`````````````````````````````````````
- An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations. 

- Some IDSâ€™s are capable of responding to detected intrusion upon discovery.

IDS Detection Types
````````````````````
+ Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS)
````````````````````````````````````````````
	- A system/hardware that analyzes incoming network traffic.




+ Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS)
```````````````````````````````````````````````
	- A system that monitors important operating system files.




+ Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS):
```````````````````````````````````````````````````
	- It is trying to secure the web server by regularly monitoring the HTTPS protocol stream and accept the related HTTP protocol.



+ Application Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (APIDS):
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
	- It identifies the intrusions by monitoring and interpreting the communication on application-specific protocols.

+ Hybrid Intrusion Detection System :
`````````````````````````````````````
	- In the hybrid intrusion detection system, host agent or system data is combined with network information to develop a complete view of the network system.


Detection Method of IDS:
`````````````````````````
+ Signature-based:
``````````````````
- looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic
- Although signature-based IDS can easily detect known attacks
- it is impossible to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.



+ Anomaly-based:
````````````````
- a newer technology designed to detect and adapt to unknown attacks
- detection method uses machine learning to create a defined model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this trust model.

What is an Intrusion Prevention System?
```````````````````````````````````````

- An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an network security device used to monitor and respond to potential threats.

- The main functions of an IPS are to identify suspicious activity, log relevant information, attempt to block the activity, and finally to report it.

Detection mechanisms:
`````````````````````

- Address matching
- HTTP string and substring matching
- Generic pattern matching
- TCP connection analysis
- Packet anomaly detection
- Traffic anomaly detection
- TCP/UDP port matching


IPS Classifications
```````````````````

Network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS): 
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
- Analyzes protocol activity across the entire network, looking for any untrustworthy traffic.

Wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS): 
````````````````````````````````````````````
- Analyzes network protocol activity across the entire wireless network, looking for any untrustworthy traffic.

Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS):
``````````````````````````````````````````````
- that follows a single host for malicious activity, and analyzes events occurring within said host.

IPS Detection Methods
`````````````````````
Signature-based detection: 
``````````````````````````
- Signature-based IDS monitors packets in the network and compares with predetermined attack patterns, known as â€œsignaturesâ€.

Statistical anomaly-based detection: 
````````````````````````````````````
- An anomaly-based IPS will monitor network traffic and compare it to expected traffic patterns. 

- The baseline will identify what is "normal" for that network â€“ what sort of packets generally through the network and what protocols are used.

- it may raise a false positive alarms

-c : config

Initializing rule chains...
0 Snort rules read
    0 detection rules
    0 decoder rules
    0 preprocessor rules
0 Option Chains linked into 0 Chain Headers

Time to configure own rules:
`````````````````````````````
** Snort rules are devided into two logical sections, the rule header and the rule options. **

1. Rule Header: The rule header contains the rule's action, protocol, source and destination IP address and netmask, the source and destination port information.

2. Rule Options: The rule option section contains alert message and information on which part of packet should be inspected to determine if rule action should be taken.


Rule Syntax:
````````````

alert <proto> <src_ip> <src_port> -> <dst_ip> <dst_port> (msg:"<msg>"; sid:"<signature>"; rev:1;)



For custom rule, signature ID starts from 100001, before 100000 reserved for snort.


Rule Actions:
`````````````
alert		: Alert and log the packet
log		: log the packet
pass		: ignore the packet
drop		: block and log the packet
reject		: block the packet, log it and send TCP reset 
sdrop		: block the packet and do not log it

______________________
d) FLAG detection rule:
```````````````````````
F - FIN 
S - SYN
R - RST
P - PSH
A - ACK
U - URG
0 (zero) - NO FLAG

There are also logical operators:
`````````````````````````````````
+ - ALL flag, match on all specified flags plus any others
* - ANY flag, match on any of the specified flags
! - NOT flag, match if the specified flags aren't set in the packet

# vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET any (flags: S; msg: "SYN Packet"; sid: 1000003; rev: 1;)


# snort -A console -q -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf


NOTE: To check use 'scapy' IP()/TCP()

>>> a = IP()
>>> b = TCP()
>>> a.src = "x.x.x.x"
>>> a.dst = "x.x.x.x"
>>> b.flags = "S"
>>> send(a/b)

_________________________
e) Content Matching rule:
`````````````````````````
# vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg: "SSH Attempt"; content: "SSH"; sid: 1000003; rev: 1;)

# snort -A console -q -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

02/13-12:56:02.128231  [**] [1:1000003:1] SSH Attempt [**] [Priority: 0] {TCP} 192.168.86.1:38256 -> 192.168.86.128:22


NOTE: To check use 'scapy' IP()/TCP()

>>> a = IP()
>>> b = TCP()
>>> a.src = "x.x.x.x"
>>> a.dst = "x.x.x.x"
>>> b.flags = "S"
>>> send(a/b/"SSH")

____________________________
f) logging and storing ASCII:
`````````````````````````````

# vim /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (content: "SSH"; msg: "SSH Attempt"; sid: 1000003; rev: 1;)

# snort -A console -q -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -K ascii

02/13-12:56:02.128231  [**] [1:1000003:1] SSH Attempt [**] [Priority: 0] {TCP} 192.168.86.1:38256 -> 192.168.86.128:22

# cd /var/log/snort/

=> One log file which is common:

# ls -l snort.log*

You can also open this file in wireshark.

=> If '-K ascii' used, then it will start logging for individual host:

# cd x.x.x.x;ls
TCP:38256-22

_____________
g) Variables:
`````````````You can also create new `var` for rules:

Syntax: var: <name> <value>

var MY_NET [192.168.1.0/24,10.1.1.0/24]
alert tcp any any -> $MY_NET any (flags: S; msg: "SYN packet";)





_____________
h) Classtype:
`````````````
The classtype keyword is used to categorize a rule as detecting an attack. Snort provides a default set of attack classes that are used by the default set of rules it provides.

Syntax: classtype:<class name>;

Attack classifications defined by Snort reside in the `classification.config` file. 

____________
i) priority:
````````````
The priority tag assigns a severity level to rules. A classtype rule assigns a default priority in `classification.config` file. A priority of 1 (high) is the most severe and 4 (very low) is the least severe.

Syntax: priority:<priority integer>;

alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"EXPLOIT"; classtype:attempted-admin; priority:10 );
