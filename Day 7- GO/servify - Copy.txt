- A front end server wont have real IPs and IPs in same network range (Common IP addr)

- Both can be load balancers hosting same website

- Reverse lookup wont be possible if there is shared hosting
- Word press gives service to host websites on their servers

AWS <------ WordPress <--------- Client (Servify)

- .com .in .tech all running on AWS


A & PTR Record  -> identify Hosting
SOA Record 	-> identify backend original server
TXT Record 	-> check if target domain is using mail spamming protection

In TXT record look for 
1. SPF (Sender policy framework)
2. DKF (Domain Key Identified Mail)
3. DMARC (Domain based Message Auth, Reporting and Conformance)

First check MX record, if present, check TXT record

cat targets.txt | xargs -I@ -P100 bash -c "host -t mx @ "

## Multi Threading to check for domain which have MX record and does not have TXT record

cat targets.txt | xargs -I@ -P100 bash -c "host -t mx @ | grep -v 'has no MX record' | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -u" | xargs -I@ -P100 bash -c "host -t txt @ | grep 'no TXT record' | cut -d' ' -f1"
